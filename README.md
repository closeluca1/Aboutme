# Aboutme
Between October and November 2018 I found what I wanted to learn, programming, but a some months ago I had already took a Python course that I did not like, however taught me a lot. In mid-2013 I edited, with the help of internet tutorials, game servers, ended up learning HTML and DB, nothing too deep. When I found what I wanted to do, I decided not to be a "tutorial boy" anymore and really learn. Today I don't concede drop something I want to learn, I don't know how long it will take, but I know I'll learn. November 2019; I have a year of experience on the engine, Construct, 4 games made for computer platform and 7 games for mobile platform. Knowledge in, HTML5 English, CSS and programming logic. I am focusing my time on JS; I will be updating this file annually.
